# Scribble-Code-Compiler-using-OCR
This is my final year project Scribble Code Compiler using OCR in which the handwritten code on paper is shown to camera on interface and text is extracted from it using OCR model. After extracting the text the code is compiled on same interface and generates output or error(if any) from it.
